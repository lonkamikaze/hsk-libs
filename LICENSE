# "THE BEER-WARE LICENSE HIGH SPEED EDITION" (Revision 42):
# <kamikaze@bsdforen.de> wrote these files. You can do whatever you want with
# this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think this stuff is worth it, you
# can buy me a beer in return or support High Speed Karlsruhe.

Thanks and a beer of my own (should we meet again) go to Poul-Henning Kamp
for the original beer-ware license.
