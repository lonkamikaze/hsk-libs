# "THE BEER-WARE LICENSE HIGH SPEED EDITION" (Revision 42):
# <kamikaze@bsdforen.de> wrote these files. As long as you retain this notice
# you can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you
# think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return or become a
# sponsor of High Speed Karlsruhe.                             Dominic Fandrey

Thanks and a beer of my own (should we meet again) go to Poul-Henning Kamp
for the original beer-ware license.
